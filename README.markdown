BA.net AdBlock Chrome Extension will block over 10000 ad domains, tracking sites and malware. Easy button to toogle on/off from the toolbar.
It is limited to the top 10000 domains and keywords in order to consume the minimum amount of cpu and memory on your browser.

The pac file at ba.net/adblock/1.pac is downloaded to your browser to block domains locally. So there is no proxy induced slowdown at all.

To use a more complete block list (up to 180k domains) you can use our free DNS Adblock service or AdBlock VPN at <a href="https://ba.net/adblockvpn/">ba.net/adblockvpn</a>
Using our DNS service will block more ads and can be used on multiple computers, mobiles or your whole network.

<p>Have Fun!
